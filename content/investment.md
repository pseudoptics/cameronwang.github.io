# Self Investment

According to Darvin and Norton's Model of Investment, there are three distinct elements towards investment: identity, which is defined as "how a person understands
his or her relationship to the world, how that relationship is structured across time and space, and how the person understands responsibilites for the future" by Norton,
ideology, which is defined as "the power to impose and to inculcate principles of construction of reality" by Bourdieu, and capital, which is defined as "exchanging resources
for value".

I originally did not decide to head into the field of engineering, rather, I began with the goal of becoming a game developer, due to my love for video games. As part of achieving my goal, 
I chose to study technology centered subjects at school, such as Information Software and Technology (IST) for Year 9 and 10, and Information Processes and Technology (IPT) and Software Design and Development (SDD),
for the HSC, which also further deepened my passion towards technology. Alongside my studies at school, I would also spend much of my own personal time to self-study programming, utilising online courses such as 
Codecademy, and purchasing physical textbooks to understand the mindset and process of programming, learning C++, Python, and HTML/CSS. During the HSC, as my project for the Industrial Technology Multimedia subject, 
I decided to develop a computer game utilising my understanding and knowledge of programming I had developed up to that point. While developing of the game, I discovered that I solely enjoyed the programming
aspects of my project, which set me on my path to becoming a software engineer.

During Year 11, 2016, I participated with my fellow classmates in the Zero Robotics High School Tournament hosted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where students program robots called
SPHERES (Synchronized Position Hold Engage and Reorient Experimental Satellites) inside the International Space Station, using C++ and their custom funcntions. Acting as the Lead Programmer for my team, the
experience taught me a lot beyond programming. Real world software development is accomplished in teams, so the competition provided significant experience towards developing my teamworking, communication,
leadership and team management skills, which are all important skills for a professional software engineer to possess.

Even during University, I continue to be invested in my field of engineering, being a member of the Programmers Society at UTS, and participating in their workshops and competitions. I have currently participated
in the ProgSoc StuVac Hackathon, where, as a team of four, had to conceptualise and develop a working project within a short time limit, and the ProgSoc Programming Competition, where teams of three
programmed solutions to several challenges. Participating in these activities further increased my knowledge and skills in programming and engineering.

Aside from programming, I also have an interest towards technology and robotics. Together with my high school friend Ben Lynch, spend a day every week to learn how to use and program Arduinos.

Each significant moment in my journey never had the intention to purposefully develop myself. Participation in competitions and challenges were all just for the fun and enjoyment of my programming hobby,
to utilise the skills I had been learning. However, as I now continue my journey to becoming a professional software engineer, each moment had been an investment, helping me develop the skills and knowledge
I need to grow.
