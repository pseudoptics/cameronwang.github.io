Hello. My name is Cameron Wang (Student ID: 13202320), and I am currently a 2nd Year Student studying a Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) and Diploma in Engineering Practice degree at University of Technology Sydney (UTS).
Due to my love for programming, as my future career, I currently aspire to break into the field of IT and Engineering, working as a software engineer to develop reliable, efficient, secure and high-quality software systems.
