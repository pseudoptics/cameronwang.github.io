# Who Am I?

Hello. My name is Cameron Wang (Student ID: 13202320), and I am currently a 2nd Year Student studying a Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) and Diploma in Engineering Practice degree at University of Technology
Sydney (UTS). Inspired by my love for video games, and my passion towards computers and technology as a whole, I currently aspire to break into the field of IT and Engineering, working as a software engineer
to develop reliable, efficient, secure and high-quality software systems.

My interests also lie in cyber security, being a part of the Cyber Security Society at UTS, as well as participating in security competitions such as Capture The Flags (CTF). My Cyber Security work and
experience can be read at my Cyber Security Portfolio [Here](https://pseudoptics.me).
