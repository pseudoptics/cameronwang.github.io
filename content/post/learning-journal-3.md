## Industry Event
### Sirius Technology TECH TALKS IV

On the 28th March 2019, Sirius Technology, a Technology recruitment branch of Sirius People, hosted their first TECH TALKS event of 2019, TECH TALKS IV. TECH TALKS is a networking event where three
speakers discuss various topics relating to engineering and information technology, with TECH TALKS IV hosting Daniel Tome, a Technical Lead, Stephanie Campanella, a Thought Leader, and Suchet Bargoti,
an expert in Field Robotics.

The first talk of the event was "Building High-Performing Agile Engineering Teams", presented by Daniel Tome. In his presentation, Tome discusses the principles that should be followed to lead towards 
high-performing engineering teams, describing the concepts that he often follows when structuring engineering teams.

The second talk of the event was “Women Who Lead”, presented by Stephanie Campanella. Starting off as a young graphics designer, Campanella became a part of the Technology Industry, and describes her 
principles and advice that allowed her to become successful in the Field of Information Technology. Although the background of the presentation is centered towards women and the IT industry, the concepts 
discussed can be applied towards my own situations and goals, advice to be confident and work towards goals without fear of failure.

The final talk of the event was "Field Robotics and Machine Learning for Remote Infrastructure Inspection", presented by Suchet Bargoti. Leading the technical vision at Abyss Solutions, their business
focuses on developing field robotics designed to reduce costs, risks, and disruptions associated with structural inspections on remote assets, which include ships, offshore rigs, and underwater pipelines.
Their systems allow for accurate, high-quality data captures through remote inspections without requiring physical on site presense. With large amounts of collected data using these systems, Abyss Solutions
have begun applying machine learning as a means to accurately and quickly gain a complete understanding of the structural health of assets. Bargoti discusses the key innovations in field robotics, machine
learning and data analytics of their business to challenge the current issues and transform the current infrastructure inspections industry.
