# Learning Journal 2
## Critical Incident
### UTS Programmers' Society Programming Competition

During September 2018, the Programmers' Society at UTS, sponsored by WiseTech Global, hosted a programming competition where teams of two or three compete against one another to solve a number of programming
challenges, leveling from beginner to challenging, quickly and efficiently within the given time limit. The top teams in the competition were provided the opportunity to participate in the International
Collegiate Programming Content (ICPC), a worldwide annual elite programming competition for undergraduate university students. The ProgSoc Programming Competition provided an opportunity to practice, develop
and utilise my programming abilities, and as a team of three, collaborated to approach eight challenges within a four hour time period.

Members:

- Cameron Wang (Me) - Software Engineer

- Wasif Hossain - Software Engineer

- Michael Ng - Software Engineer

The competition began on the Saturday, 15th September, at 11:00am. As each team is only provided access to a single computer, Michael and I were tasked to program the solutions, taking turns between each challenge, while
Wasif focused on solving the challenges through written pseudocode, which Michael and I would convert into Java code.

Overall, my team performed very successfully, placing 6th out of a total of 25 teams, able to accomplish three out of the eight challenges with the first submission. However, being first year students, there is definitely room
for growth and development for our skills, especially revolving around problem analysis and solving, and efficiency. Although we were able to effectively solve three of the challenges in a single attempt, our speed in analyzing and
solving the challenge was slow, and can definitely be improved. Challenge #6 tested our level of programming efficiency, as it took two submissions, and was unable to run in the compeition system due to programming inefficiency.
