# Learning Journal 5
## Peer-Review Feedback
### Professional Assessment Activity 1

On the 4th April 2019, my peer group participated in the Professional Assessment Activity 1 during our Engineering Practice Preparation 1 (EPP1) class, where we viewed each others drafted e-portfolios, and
provided feedback on any positive aspects of their e-portfolio that they have done well, alongside any aspects that could use improvement.

According to the peer reviews from my group members, I have been receiving positive feedback on my e-portfolio. The design of the website is good, the learning journals are well written and detailed, with images
to support my work, and all of the content required for the first Professional Assessment Activity was available. However, one main issue that I received was my 'About Me' page, which contained a brief overview
about me and my degree, but could use more detail, such as including my areas of interests, to further flesh out the type of person I am. I have taken in all of my feedback, and I will ensure that I continue
to improve upon my e-portfolio based on this feedback.
