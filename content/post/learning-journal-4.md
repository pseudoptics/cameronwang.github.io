### Engineering Practice

When people think about engineering or view visualisations of engineering, blueprints, sketches and models of building structures and electronics are usually common imagery. However, the photo I have taken
of my code properly demonstrates the concept of engineering practice for me personally.

Engineering is applying science and mathematics to innovate, design, construct, operate and maintain structure, machines, materials, devices, systems, processes, and organisations. As such, one field of
engineering is software, which applies the concepts of engineering towards development and maintenance of software systems and solutions; the field of engineering I am currently pursuing.

The photo I have presented as my representation of engineering practice is an image of my code, taken from one of my Applications Programming assignments, where I was tasked to develop an application
that allowed users to select computer parts from a catalogue, and add it to their build, which also checks their build for all the necessary parts. The assignment was both difficult and fun to complete,
teaching me the fundamentals in developing GUI Applications in Java, along with understanding the fundamentals of the MVC (Model, View, Controller) Architecture.

Although developing a working solution is the end goal of a software developer, an important aspect to software engineering is writing code that is both readable and manageable for others, as well as
efficient. Software development in the real world are accomplished in teams, so code needs to be clean and concise to be understandable to other team members, with comments which describe the fuctionality
of each section, allowing them to review and further improve upon the current version. Another important aspect of programming is efficiency, ensuring that the program is quick in performing the required
task. This is achieved by shortening the code as short as possible, which is achieved through utilization of patterns.
