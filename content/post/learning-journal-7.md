## Critical Incident
### Importance of Feedback / Professional Assessment Activity

When conducting any form of work, feedback is an important aspect towards learning and growth. Feedback highlights the aspects of work that are positive, along with the negative aspects which are discussed
to initiate improvement. One aspect that the Engineering Practice Preparation 1 (EPP1) teaches is on the importance of feedback, both providing and receiving feedback, through the Professional Assessment
Activities which are spread out throughout the course of the subject. Students are placed into Peer Review Groups, where each student review and provide feedback on their peers on their progress on their
e-portfolio.

Although feedback tends to focus on negative aspects of work so individuals are able to improve on them, EPP1 teaches that feedback should begin with any positives rather than on areas that need improvement.
By beginning with the positives, individuals will be more willing to listen to the negatives that follow, and learn to improve on them, rather than beginning with negatives, which may make them less willing
to improve. Worksheets are provided for each of the Professional Assessment Activities, which provide a template on how feedback should be presented. Positives are listed first, followed by any improvements
that can be made, then a discussion on the positive outcomes expected from the feedback.
