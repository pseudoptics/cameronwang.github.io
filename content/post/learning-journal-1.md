# Learning Journal 1
## Critical Incident
### UTS Programmers' Society Hackathon

While I was in my first year at University, I participated in the UTS Programmers Societyâ€™s Code2Learn Hackathon. 
Partnered with WiseTech Global, the twenty-nine hour competition tasked teams to conceptualise and develop a program or device which will support students University life. 
Part of the given time limit was to create a presentation, which was to be presented at the end of the competition.

As part of a team of four, our project was a virtual classroom application which would enable students to join group chats relating to their specific topics they require assistance in and post their questions, 
while UTS tutors would be present in these group chats to provide support and assistance to every question through the chat. With a multitude of questions being posted at any given time, 
a voting system was implemented, where questions with the most votes are prioritised to be answered by the tutor first.

However, due to the strict time limit of the competition, we were only able to accomplish a working prototype of the solution we wished to achieve.

I was tasked to create and conduct the presentation of our project, providing the overview of the application and its functionality, and our progress through the Hackathon. 
The presentation was to be shown to an audience consisting of members of the Programmers Society and the Robotics Society, participants of the competition, and mentors from WiseTech Global. 
However, due to my lack of confidence and social anxiety during the time, I ended up stuttering on my words, and looking away from the audience.

The incident was extremely stressful. The incomplete product along with my terrible composure while presenting to individuals in the industry left me feeling embarrassed and ashamed, 
but is an important experience I do not regret. 
The incident has shown me the skills, both technical with programming, and interpersonal with speaking and communication skills, that I still currently need to develop.
