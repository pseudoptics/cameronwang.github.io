# Learning Journal 6
## Peer-Review Feedback
### Professional Assessment Activity 2

On the 18th April 2019, my peer group participated in the Professional Assessment Activity 2 during our Engineering Practice Preparation 1 (EPP1) class, where we viewed the progress made with each of our
e-portfolios, looking towards any improvements from the previous Professional Assessment Activity, as well as any further progress with learning journals and portfolio content.

My e-portfolio is currently receiving positive feedback, according to the reviews I have received from my group memebers. I have shown good progress since the previous review, adding two new learning
journals, and an article discussing my investment towards becoming an engineer. However, I have still currently not updated my "About Me" page, or included the required sections, such as the "SMART Goals",
which will all be updated and included by the final version.
