# Subject Learning Objectives (SLOs)

The Engineering Practice Preparation 1 subject lists the Subject Learning Objectives as the following:

1. Articulate preparedness for participating in an engineering workplace
2. Document and communicate their capabilities to contribute to a workplace and engage in workplace learning

The first SLO is demonstrated through my article on my employability, where I analysed internship opportunities and curated resumes based on the requirements and expectations listed in the advertisement.
My preparedness is further demonstrated with my visit to an engineering industry event, allowing me to learn more about the mindset and practices that many professional engineers follow in the workplace,
as well as provide a good opportunity for networking and connections, which are important for breaking into the industry.

The second SLO is demonstrated through my e-portfolio, and the articles and learning journals that I have written throughout the subject. The learning journals consist of critical incidents, looking at
past events and reflecting on my learning and growth from the experiences, my reflections on my investment to becoming an engineer and my own personal views on engineering, and on the weekly topics of
the EPP1 subject.
