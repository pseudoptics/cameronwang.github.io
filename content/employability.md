# Internship Oppotunities

It is important, when applying for job and internship opportunities, that a resume is prepared. Depending on the job that is being applied for, the resume should also
be customised to suit that position, to display the related skills, experience and achievements to increase the chances of employability. It is considered best practice to have a 
basic, general resume prepared, which can be modified to suit the aimed position.

On LinkedIn, Google has listed a Software Engineering Internship advertisement for Summer of 2019. Regarding technical skills, the minimum qualifications states that the employer is looking for
experience in general purpose programming languages such as Java, C/C++ and Python. The employer also preferres employees with experience in systems software or algorithms, knowledge of Unix/Linux
and APIs and familiarity with TCP/IP and network programming. Alongside technical skills, the employer also looks for employees with interpersonal skills with public speaking/presentation and
teamwork/communication, as stated in the description, "present new ideas" and "focus on being a collaborative, global organization consisting of engineers", and in their Responsibilities section with the
keyword 'Collaborate'.

To increase my chances of employability, my resume should be modified to highlight the skills that the advertisement specifies. I need to display my skills in Java, C++, and Python by describing my
experience through university, clubs, and competitions, as well as show my proficiency in using Unix/Linux systems through my cyber security experiences.

The company Atlassian has also advertised an internship through LinkedIn, a 2019/2020 Summer Internship Program for a Security position. Reading through the job description, the employer expects
experience with object-oriented programming languages such as Java or Python, as well as being able to write scripts rather than depending on existing software, and competing in cyber security
challenges and competitions. Although not required, the employer also looks for real passion for software engineering through previous internships, work experience, projects, or publications, a deep
understanding of data structures and their implementations to solve problems, and familiarity with common design patterns. Interpersonal skillsets are an important aspect for the employer, as shown
through statements such as "collaboration with development teams" and "working with development teams", so displaying skills in communication and teamwork is important.

For this resume, the modifications will be similar to the software engineering internship version, however, it will instead focus more towards my accomplishments in the cyber security field. I have
included a link to my cyber security portfolio in my resume, as that contains the bulk of my security experience. I have also changed the Career Objective to focus more towards cyber security than
software engineering.
